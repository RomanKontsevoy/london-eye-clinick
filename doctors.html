        <h2>
            <small>Tribute by <strong> David Cohen </strong></small>
        </h2>


        <p>
            It has been over 8 months since Jimmy left us and we all, in our own ways, are coming to terms with the
            immense loss of a beloved husband, father, father-in-law grandfather and friend.
        </p>

        <p>
            Such was Jimmy&rsquo;s impact during his lifetime that we cherish the joy and warmth of so many memories and
            in that we gain consolation...
        </p>

        <p>
            Over the past few months there have been so many words of praise, respect and affection spoken of Jimmy. We
            remember the inspiring words of Dayan Binstock during the week of shiva. There have been numerous letters
            from all over the world from patients and friends.
        </p>

        <p>
            It is my privilege to pay tribute to our friend although it involves deep emotion. but as it says in the
            Talmud &ldquo;He in whom the spirit of his fellow creatures takes delight, in him the spirit of G-d takes
            delight.&rdquo; In Jimmy we took delight.
        </p>

        <p>
            In every aspect of his life: family, personal, religious, professional, Jimmy was a very special person. His
            moral character was upright, his home life beautiful, he was a faithful friend, kind- hearted and generous.
            He had a high intellect and he was a superb medical practitioner.
        </p>

        <p>
            Jimmy had a &ldquo;shem tov&rdquo;&mdash;a good name. In the seventh chapter of Ecclesiastes there is the
            declaration that &ldquo;a good name is better than precious oil and the day of death better than the day of
            one&rsquo;s birth&rdquo;. Now, in the jewish interpretation, this loses its touch of pessimism and shows the
            teaching of our faith in relation to life and death. it means that to a man who has so lived that he has
            been crowned with a good name, that accompanies him into the hereafter. Jimmy was crowned with a good name.
        </p>

        <p>
            He was a man gifted with talents far beyond the normal, and to those gifts were added a charm of
            disposition, a warmth of heart, a humane caring spirit and a depth of spiritual insight.
        </p>

        <p>
            Many of us have seen, and relished, a remarkable side of Jimmy. Who can fail to recall with great sentiment,
            the wonderful speech that he made at his 70th birthday party?
        </p>

        <p>
            On that occasion we had an insight into his philosophy of life, and his deep belief and ideals, at a time
            when the calls on his courage and stamina had become immense.
        </p>

        <p>
            When he had finished speaking that day, we were lost for words as we absorbed what had been a most moving
            moment. And who can fail to have been humbled by witnessing how Jimmy fought his illness with such immense
            resolution, tenacity and deep faith?
        </p>

        <p>
            And then&mdash;his fight was over, and as in the beautiful words of Robert Browning : &ldquo;Like a hand
            which ends a dream, death with the might of his sunbeam, touches the flesh and the soul awakes...&rdquo;
        </p>

        <p>
            Many of us have experienced Jimmy&rsquo;s quiet bright humour and sheer enjoyment of life, in which his
            beloved Ruth meant everything.
        </p>

        <p>
            And did we have fun! I recall with pleasure so many episodes: wonderful dinners; holidays; terrible breaches
            of etiquette at the snooker table; tangled ropes on boats; brilliant fancy dress costumes at memorable
            parties; countless celebrations; considerable laughter.
        </p>

        <p>
            There was his ability to sleep right through high drama on board a yacht drifting, out of control, in a
            storm, in the path of an oncoming giant ferry; there was the discovery of his talent as a rap artist; there
            were his witty parodies composed for parties; there was his utterly brilliant ability to do an authentic
            morris dance&mdash;whilst keeping a straight face. And so much more.
        </p>

        <p>
            Jimmy was a revelation. There was not just his more serious side when his thirst for knowledge, his
            enquiring mind and his great intelligence made him such stimulating and rewarding company.
        </p>

        <p>
            I know that his memory will be an abiding inspiration to his family&mdash;of whom he was so proud&mdash;and
            it will remain a beautiful possession of us all.
        </p>

        <p>
            I want to close with these lines of William Wordsworth: &ldquo;...and when the stream which overflowed the
            soul was passed away, a consciousness remained that it had left, deposited upon the silent shore of memory,
            images and precious thoughts that shall not die, and cannot be destroyed...&rdquo;
        </p>
